            <img class="famphoto" src="/images/SFAOfS.jpg" alt="photo of my family">
            <p>In 2010, I studied IT at MTI tenchnical institute in Sacramento, CA and received my A+ certification and other microsoft technical support certifications.
                <br>During school I was hired at Comcast in the technical support department, then I went to an IT company in Berkeley where i was staging and setting up work stations at client locations.
                <br>My wife and I also had a brick and mortar business together, serving 3 malls in the bay area, but we eventually closed them to start a new life in the <b class="places">Central Valley</b>.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am learning to code at <b class="places">CodeStackAcademy</b> in Stockton, ca.  With my experience, and willingness to solve problems,  I decided to learn to code.
                <br>I also wanted to stay in a field where i can continue learning and eventually use this skill for a future business in our retirement years.</p>
